# Todo List Project

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Users can add new tasks to their todo list.
- **Delete Tasks:** Users can remove tasks from their list once they are completed or no longer needed.
- **Mark as Completed:** Users can mark tasks as completed, helping them keep track of what has been done.
